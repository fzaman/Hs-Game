Hs-Game
=======
A Haskell library for basic game theory.

Inspired by the course /Algorithmic Game Theory/ at Technische Universität München (TUM). The library provides datatypes for normal form games and extensive form games as well as a selection of algorithms.


TODO
----
- Unit tests and QuickCheck-based tests
- Formalize correctness requirements of algorithms
- Algorithms for Nash Equilibrium
- Basic support for Extensive-form games
- Coalition games (Core, Least Core, Nucleolus and Shapley Value)
